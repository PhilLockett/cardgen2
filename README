cardgen
=====

cardgen is a command-line utility that images representing playing cards.

The code generates a bash script the makes multiple calls to the ImageMagick 
command, convert, to draw a standard pack of playing cards. It is very 
configurable, allowing or playing cards of greatly varying styles to be 
created.

Installing from tarball
-----------------------

The install process described in the INSTALL document is a generic 
description of the install process. The install process is also described 
in the ‘Card Generator User Guide.pdf’ document. For completeness the install 
process is also described below. All three descriptions are essentially the 
same and clearly, it only needs to be installed once.

The install you will need a C++ compiler and make installed to compile 
cardgen from a release tarball. You will also need the ImageMagick image 
processing suite installed. The following command will unpack the tarball.

$ tar zxf cardgen-1.0.tar.gz

After unpacking, cd to the toplevel directory, cardgen-1.0, and issue the 
following shell commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
